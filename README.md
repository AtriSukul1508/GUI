<h1 align="center">GUI</h1>

<h2 align="center"> This Reusable GUI is based on an idea to create templates in react for people to use them later in their projects. </h2>

The Reuable GUI is the concept to reduce the development time in react projects. Here we would create some pages that are used very commonly.

<h3> üìå Contribution Guidelines üèó </h3>

Are we missing any of your favorite features, which you think you can implement‚ùì If yes, We invite you to contribute to this project and make it better. 
To start contributing, follow the steps given below: 

**1.**  Fork [this](https://github.com/muhammad-ahmed02/GUI/fork) repository.

**2.**  Clone your forked copy of the project.

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourGithubUsername/GUI.git
```

**3.** Navigate to the project directory.
```
   cd GUI
```

**4.** Create a new branch:
```
   git checkout -b YourBranchName
```

**5.** Make changes in source code.

**6.** Stage your changes and commit

```
   git add .
   git commit -m "<your_commit_message>"
```

**7.** Push your local commits to the remote repo.

```
   git push origin YourBranchName
```

**8.** Create a [PR](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)

**9.** If anyone will contribute to this repository, then those changes will not be reflected in your local repository. For fixing that:

**10.** Setup a reference(remote) to the original repository to get all the changes from the remote.
```
   git remote add upstream  https://github.com/muhammad-ahmed02/GUI
```

**11.** Check the remotes for this repository.
```
   git remote -v
```

**12.** Fetching from the remote repository will bring in its branches and their respective commits.
```
   git fetch upstream
```

**13.** Make sure that you're on your master branch.
```
   git checkout main
```

**14.** Now that we have fetched the upstream repository, we want to merge its changes into our local branch. This will bring that branch into sync with the upstream, without losing our local changes.
```
   git merge upstream/main
```

## Code of Conduct üìú
	
To maintain a safe and inclusive space for everyone to learn and grow, contributors are advised to follow the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Get started with the project

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
